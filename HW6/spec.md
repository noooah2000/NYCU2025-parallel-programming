# Assignment VI: OpenCL Programming

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with OpenCL programming.

Get the source code:

```
$ cd <your_workplace>
$ wget https://nctu-sslab.github.io/PP-f20/HW6/HW6.zip
$ unzip HW6.zip -d HW6
```

Modify your `~/.bashrc` by adding the following configurations.

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda
```

## 1. Image convolution using OpenCL

Convolution is a common operation in image processing. It is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. The image convolution process is accomplished by doing a convolution between a small matrix (which is called a *filter kernel* in image processing) and an image. You may learn more about the convolution process at [Wikipedia: Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution).

Figure 1 shows an illustration of the concept of applying a convolution filter to a specific pixel, value of which is `3`. After the convolution process, the value of the pixel becomes `7`—how the resulting value is computed is illustrated on the right of the figure.

Figure 1. Applying a convolution filter to the dark gray pixel of the source image (value of which is `3`).

In this assignment, you will need to implement a GPU kernel function for convolution in OpenCL by using the zero-padding method. A serial implementation of convolution can be found in `serialConv()` in `serialConv.c`. You can refer to the implementation to port it to OpenCL. You may refer to [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cnn-introduction-to-padding/) to learn about the zero-padding method. Figure 2 shows an example of applying the zero-padding method to the source image (on the left) and thereby resulting a same-size, filtered output image (on the right).

Figure 2. Applying the zero-padding method to a source image.

Your job is to parallelize the computation of the convolution using OpenCL. A starter code that spawns OpenCL threads is provided in function `hostFE()`, which is located in `hostFE.c`. `hostFE()` is the host front-end function that allocates memories and launches a GPU kernel, called `convolution()`, which is located in `kernel.cl`.

Currently `hostFE()` and `convolution()` do not do any computation and return immediately. You should complete these two functions to accomplish this assignment.

You can build the program by typing `make`, and run the program via `./conv`. Your program should read an input image from `input.bmp`, perform image convolution, and output the result image into `output.bmp`.

You can use the following command to test your own image:

```
ffmpeg -i source.png -pix_fmt gray -vf scale=600:400 destination.bmp
```

You can use a different filter kernel by adding option `-f N` when running the program (i.e., `./conv -f N`), where N is either 1 (by default), 2, or 3, and indicates which filter kernel is used. Each filter kernel is defined in a CSV file (`filter1.csv`, `filter2.csv`, or `filter3.csv`). The first line of the CSV file defines the width (or height) of the filter kernel, and the remaining lines define the values of the filter kernel.

## 2. Requirements

You will modify only `hostFE.c` and `kernel.cl`.

**Q1 (*5 points*)**: Explain your implementation. How do you optimize the performance of convolution?

**[Bonus] Q2 (*10 points*)**: Rewrite the program using CUDA. (1) Explain your CUDA implementation, (2) plot a chart to show the performance difference between using OpenCL and CUDA, and (3) explain the result.

Answer the questions marked with **Q1** (and **Q2**) in a **REPORT** using [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/).
Notice that in this assignment a higher standard will be applied when grading the quality of your report.

**Note: You cannot print any message in your program.**

## 3. Grading Policies

**NO CHEATING!!** You will receive no credit if you are found cheating.

Total of 100+10%:

* Correctness (75%): 25% for each of the three filters (`filter1.csv`, `filter2.csv`, and `filter3.csv`). The breakdown of the 25%:
  + 10%: Your parallelized program passes the verification.
  + 15%: The speedup over the serial version should be greater than 5.0.
* Performance (20%): Compete with your classmates. See the metric below.
* Questions (5+10%).

Metric:

\[\frac{T-Y}{T-F} \times 60\%, \text{if} \; Y < T +
\begin{cases}
20\%, \text{if} \; Y < F \times 2 \\\\
40\%, \text{if} \; Y < F \times 1.5
\end{cases}\]

where $Y$ and $F$ indicate the execution time of your program and the fastest program, respectively, and $T = F \times 1.5$.

## 4. Evaluation Platform

Your program should be able to run on UNIX-like OS platforms. We will evaluate your programs on the workstations dedicated for this course. You can access these workstations by `ssh` with the following information.

The workstations are based on Ubuntu 18.04 with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7500 CPU @ 3.40GHz processors and **GeForce GTX 1060 6GB**. `g++-10`, `clang++-11`, `cuda10.2`, and `OpenCL1.1` have been installed.

| IP | Port | User Name | Password |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 140.113.215.195 | 37077, 37093, 37094 | {student\_id} | {Provided by TA} |

> ***Notice***: We will only use one of the ports above to grade the assignments.

> ***ATTENTION: Never touch 37095. It is for NIS and NFS.***

Login example:

```
$ ssh <student_id>@140.113.215.195 -p <port>
```

You can use the testing script `test_hw6` to check your answer *for reference only*. Run `test_hw6` in a dictionary that contains your `HW6_XXXXXXX.zip` file on the workstation.

## 5. Submission

All your files should be organized in the following hierarchy and zipped into a `.zip` file, named `HW6_xxxxxxx.zip`, where `xxxxxxx` is your student ID.

Directory structure inside the zipped file:

* `HW6_xxxxxxx.zip` (root)
  + `kernel.cl`
  + `hostFE.c`
  + `url.txt`

Notice that you just need to provide the URL of your HackMD report in `url.txt`, and enable the write permission for someone who knows the URL so that TAs can give you feedback directly in your report.

Zip the file:

```
$ zip HW6_XXXXXXX.zip kernel.cl hostFE.c url.txt
```

Be sure to upload your zipped file to new E3 e-Campus system by the due date.

**You will get *NO POINT* if your ZIP’s name is wrong or the ZIP hierarchy is incorrect.**

**Due Date: 23:59, January 7, Thursday, 2021**
